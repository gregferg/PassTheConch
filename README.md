# Pass The Conch
Pass The Conch is a short creative writing game that could be used as a writing warm up, to get some creative juices flowing, or just for fun! It is a partner based game in which both players work together to write a 10 sentence story. Each story begins with a randomly generated prompt for which the players to build off of. Each player has a minute to write a sentence, and it switches who writes a sentence back and forth until the story reaches 10 sentences.
